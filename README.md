# Brand_Analysis_Using_Twitter_Data
Brand Analysis using Twitter data was my semester group project, which compares popularity and likeability between two automobile brands. One is Tata Safari and other is Mahinndra XUV 700. The project uses Machine learning topics such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes,  Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression.
